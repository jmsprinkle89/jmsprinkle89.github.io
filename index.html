    <h3> About </h3>
    <strong> Hi everyone! On this site we have pictures of doggos and puppers who are being good bois by being well behaved or by doing cool things! My goal is to bring a smile to your face with the adorable dogs and their cute backstories. Thank you for checking out my page and don't forget to tell you friends about it! Hope you enjoy!</strong>

    <h3> PSA! </h3> <!-- the diclaimer -->
    <strong> We support ALL good bois here -good bois includes good girls- but we also support pitbulls who are often portrayed through stereotype and the media that they are not good bois. Thats not true!! Pitbulls are some of the sweetest dogs I know, people just train them to be mean which gives them a bad rep. Please be kind to pitbulls!  </strong>
